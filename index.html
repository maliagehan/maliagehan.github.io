    Malia Gehan, Ph.D. is a new Assistant Member at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, who focuses on improving resistance to temperature stress.
    Most recently, she was a Research Scientist in the Mockler Lab (Danforth Center) and a NSF-PGRP Postdoctoral Fellow.
    During her Postdoctoral research she focused on developing tools for high-throughput phenotyping.
    Through work on phenotyping, she and colleagues started a Maker Group at the Danforth Center that focuses on developing low-cost phenotyping tools, and fun outreach events (Raspberry Jams!).
    Malia earned her Ph.D. in Plant Biology at Michigan State University Plant Research labs with Dr. Mike Thomashow examining natural variation in freezing tolerance and the integration of the circadian clock with cold signaling.
    As an undergraduate researcher in Biology at Willamette University she studied thermoinhibition of growth and development of guard cell protoplasts with Dr. J. Gary Tallman.
    Malia grew up in Kaneohe, Hawaii where there is very little change in temperature, which is probably why she is so interested in temperature signaling.
    In her free time she enjoys spending time with her husband (Jackson) and sassy cats, Katness and Meowming.
